Hey everyone! My name is Mahmud Muhammad but i'm commonly known as _cybershakyh_ ,  I'm a student of Computer Science who is passionate about everything cybersecurity, I like breaking applications to understand how they work! I'm majorly into the red teaming part of cybersecurity and I mostly do ethical hacking and security research, currently i'm learning Application Security and Web/API/Mobile pentesting, I play CTFs while also solving labs/rooms on tryhackme, portswigger and hackthebox or on my homelab where I host vulnerable APIs and Web applications. Welcome to my blog where you'll find articles on topics relating to cybersecurity, Writeups of different labs and what I learn generally. I hope you learn some things here...
