Have you ever heard of the term social engineering? you might think of it as a way of improving the society? Well no, social engineering is not that at all, it is commonly known as “human hacking”. In cybersecurity, we always hear of attackers crafting the most dangerous payloads, launching denial of service attacks against billion dollar companies and stories of teenagers sitting in front of their computer screens all day with their black hoodies trying to steal money or intellectual property by circumventing the normal mode of operation of a computer system — a term known as hacking . Well, I’m here to tell you that there is a human element to every cyber attack. Social engineering as defined by Christopher J. Hadnagy is “any act that influences a person to take an action that may or may not be in his or her best interests.” It is a way of influencing people either by manipulating or convincing them into making a decision that may or may not be of harm to them. In this article, I’ll be touching on different types of social engineering attacks, how you can identify them and ways you can protect yourself against them. Many people encounter these scenarios I’m about to share but most don’t pay attention to them because we humans are not perfect and there are loopholes in our mode of thinking which makes us susceptible to attacks, hence the famous quote “ the human element is the weakest link in cybersecurity”.
